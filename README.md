# Graph Animation

This is our school curriculum tasks, in accordance with the contents of the curriculum design tasks to build a guide road map.

The version II I wrote is an animated demonstration of the graph theory algorithm based on D3, written with jQuery, Node and Express. 

In the graph, you can add/delete node and edge dynamically and you can see through the animation rendering algorithm such as DFS, BFS, MST, Dijkstra and so on.

## Dependency 

Requires Node 6.x and above.

## Build

First you need to copy the project by ```git clone https://github.com/happylindz/graph-animation.git```

There are two versions, v1 is written in C++, you can operate through the console. 

1. Type ```cd v1``` to enter v1
2. Run ```g++ main.cpp -o main``` to generate binary file.
3. Run ```./main``` to begin the project.

v2 is graph algorithm animation demo. 

2. Type ```cd v2``` to enter v2
3. Run ```npm install``` to install the dependencies
4. Run ```npm start``` to start the server
5. open browser and visit ```http://localhost:3000``` and see the result.

Enjoy yourself.
